## 4. Preparation

### Step 1: Betting Cards and Action Cards Distribution

**Betting Cards:**
- Each player takes 2 betting cards (3 cards for 2 players)
- Players check their cards secretly and place them face down
- Remaining betting cards are placed face down as a stack

**Action Cards:**
- Shuffle all action cards
- Distribute cards according to player count:

| Players | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |
|---------|---|---|---|---|---|
| Cards per player | 8 | 7 | 6 | 6 | 5 |

- Remaining action cards are not used for this game

### Step 2: Determining the Starting Order of Horse Cards

1. Choose the first player
2. The first player chooses a horse card and places it face up in the middle of the table
3. The next player (left of first player, clockwise) chooses a horse card and places it to the left or right side of the previously placed card
4. Continue in clockwise order, each player placing their chosen horse card to the left or right of all previously placed cards
5. Continue until all 7 horse cards are placed

**Important:** You cannot place a horse card between already placed horse cards. New cards can only be added to the leftmost or rightmost position.

**Example for 5 players:**
- Player 1: Places horse #4 (first card)
- Player 2: Places horse #7 on the right of #4
- Player 3: Places horse #1 on the right of #7
- Player 4: Places horse #5 on the left of #4
- Player 5: Places horse #3 on the right of #1
- Player 1: Places horse #6 on the left of #5
- Player 2: Places horse #2 on the right of #3

Final order: [6][5][4][7][1][3][2] → Front direction

### Step 3: Determining the Dark Horse

1. Flip the 7th horse card (the last remaining card) after determining the starting order
2. This becomes the **Dark Horse** for this game
3. Place Dark Horse tokens next to the horse cards according to player count:

| Players | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |
|---------|---|---|---|---|---|
| Tokens | 1 | 2 | 2 | 3 | 3 |

## 5. Gameplay

The game starts with the first player and proceeds clockwise. On each turn, a player performs the following actions in order:

### Turn Sequence

#### Action 1: Take a Dark Horse Token (Optional)

**Rules:**
- Each player can have only 1 token maximum
- If you already have a token, you cannot take another
- If there are no tokens available, you cannot take one
- **You cannot take a token when you have only 1 action card remaining in hand**

#### Action 2: Play an Action Card (Mandatory)

- Choose one action card from your hand
- Place it face up in front of you
- This card will be used in Action 3

#### Action 3: Execute the Action Card (Mandatory)

- Move horse cards according to the action card description
- Change the order of horses based on card effects

### Action Card Types and Effects

#### Standard Movement Cards

Action cards show:
- **Target horse:** Which horse to move (by horse number)
- **Direction:** Forward or backward (player's choice for some cards)
- **Distance:** Number of spaces to move

**How movement works:**
- Moving a horse means **switching positions** with another horse
- When a horse moves forward, it switches with the horse(s) ahead
- All horses that are passed move back one rank each

**Important:** Moving forward 2 spaces does NOT mean switching with the horse 2 positions ahead. It means passing 2 horses, which results in switching with the 2nd horse ahead.

**Example:**
```
Initial: [7th: #6][6th: #5][5th: #4][4th: #7][3rd: #1][2nd: #3][1st: #2]

Play card: "Move #4 horse forward 1 space"

Result: [7th: #6][6th: #5][5th: #7][4th: #4][3rd: #1][2nd: #3][1st: #2]
- Horse #4 switches with horse #7
- Horse #4 moves from 5th to 4th rank
```

**Example with 2-space movement:**
```
Initial: [7th: #6][6th: #5][5th: #4][4th: #7][3rd: #1][2nd: #3][1st: #2]

Play card: "Move #6 horse forward 2 spaces (+2)"

Result: [7th: #5][6th: #4][5th: #6][4th: #7][3rd: #1][2nd: #3][1st: #2]
- Horse #6 passes 2 horses (#5 and #4)
- Horse #6 moves from 7th to 5th rank
- Horse #5 moves to 7th rank (down 1)
- Horse #4 moves to 6th rank (down 1)
```

#### Cards with Multiple Horses

Some action cards show 2 horses that must both be moved.

**Rules:**
- You must move both horses according to the card
- Both horses can only move in the same direction (both forward OR both backward)

**Example:**
```
Card shows: "4th and 6th horse, +1"
Both horses move forward 1 space
```

#### Special Cards

**1. Rider Fall Off Card**
- Effect: Move the 3rd rank horse to the 7th rank (last place)
- All horses between shift forward one position

**2. Exchange Betting Card**
Player must choose ONE of the following actions:

**Option A:** Exchange your own betting card
- Discard one of your betting cards (reveal it to all players)
- Take a new betting card from the top of the betting card stack
- Keep the new card secret

**Option B:** Force another player to exchange
- Choose any other player
- That player must discard one of their betting cards (reveal it to all players)
- That player takes a new betting card from the top of the stack
- The new card is kept secret

### Important Rules

#### 1. Mandatory Card Play
- You must play an action card every turn, even if it disadvantages you
- No skipping turns or passing

#### 2. Mandatory Movement
- When you play an action card, you must execute its effect
- You must move the horse(s) according to the card description

#### 3. Movement Restrictions
- If a horse is at 1st rank and the card says to move it forward, you must move it backward instead
- If a horse is at 7th rank and the card says to move it backward, you must move it forward instead

**Example:**
```
Current situation: Horse #4 is in 1st rank
Card played: "Move #4 horse forward 1 space"
Action: Since #4 cannot move forward, it must move backward 1 space
```

### Game Continuation

- Players continue taking turns in clockwise order
- Each player plays one action card per turn
- The game continues until all players have played all their action cards

## 6. Game End

The game ends when all players have played all their action cards (when the last card is played).

### Final Ranking

After all action cards are played:
- The final position of horses determines their ranks
- The rightmost horse (upmost right) is **1st rank**
- Ranks decrease from right to left
- The leftmost horse is **7th rank**

**Visual representation:**
```
[7th] [6th] [5th] [4th] [3rd] [2nd] [1st] → Front
```

### Scoring

#### Step 1: Reveal Betting Cards
- All players simultaneously reveal their betting cards

#### Step 2: Calculate Base Score
- Check the final rank of each horse on your betting cards
- Score according to the scoring table on the back of betting cards
- Add up points from all your betting cards (2 cards normally, 3 cards for 2 players)

#### Step 3: Double Betting Bonus
- If you have 2 identical betting cards (same horse number), you score **double** the points for that horse
- Example: Two #3 horse betting cards, and horse #3 finishes 2nd (7 points)
  - Normal: 7 + 7 = 14 points
  - With double bonus: 7 × 2 = 14 points (same in this case, but rules state "double")

#### Step 4: Dark Horse Token Points

**If the Dark Horse finishes in 1st, 2nd, or 3rd rank:**
- Players with Dark Horse tokens get **+5 bonus points** each

**If the Dark Horse finishes in 4th, 5th, 6th, or 7th rank:**
- Players with Dark Horse tokens get **-3 penalty points** each

**Note:** The Dark Horse is the horse that was in 7th position at the start of the game (the last card flipped during setup)

#### Step 5: Determine Winner
- The player with the **highest total score** wins the game
- In case of a tie, players share the victory
